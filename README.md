# Split-and-settle
Expenditure split and debt settlement app

## Features
- This application can be used when you are with friends and you have to record how much each member has paid during a group trip or a group project and you want to divide it evenly.
- It uses 2D arrays and linked lists to calculate how much money each member owes to one another.
- An algorithm also shows the least number of transactions required to settle the debts.
