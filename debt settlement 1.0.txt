=====================
SETTLE UP APPLICATION
=====================
This application can be used when you are with friends and you have to record how much each member has paid 
during a group trip or a group project and you want to divide it evenly.

It uses 2D arrays and linked lists to calculate how much money each member owes to one another.An algorithm
also shows the least number of transactions required to settle the debts. 

1. When you run the application, it will show you a menu.
2. You first need to add atleast 2 members before you can select option other than "add member" option.
3. Select 1 to add members.
4. If you need to record a transaction in which a member paid for everyone in the group, press 2.
5. If you want to record a transcation in which a member paid for another member in group, press 3.
6. If you want to see least number of transactions required to settle up every transaction, press 4.

Hope you'll enjoy.
Stay safe :)
